# Day1: React Introduction

Using plain html how we will write "Hello World" in browser
--> Emmet(It gives some template code)
--> CDN(content delievery networks) These are the website where libraries are hosted and using cdn links we are just fetching that library in our project.

Ex# Cdn link for jquery, react, sweetAlert2, leafletjs, googlemap, fontawesome
Get React into our project, as browser don't understand react code directly.
document, createElement, appendChild, getElementById .. ect these are already available in the browser.

write "cdn react"

ReactElement(Object) ==> HTML(browser understands)

Can be single child either in array of childs if an html element have more than one childeren

At the end of day ReactElement is an Object.

createElement(name_of_the_tag, attributes, childerens)

First childeren could be a normal react element
if you have given multiple childerens, then you have to pass that ReactElement using an array.


render() is replacing data when something getting render.
